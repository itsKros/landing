            <h1 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl text-center font-medium md:w-7/12 mb-8 md:mb-12 underline">Why Are Pressure Cookers So Dangerous?</h1>
            <p class="text-md text-left font-normal md:w-10/12 mb-2">Unfortunately, many pressure cookers are made with serious design flaws that can lead to severe malfunctions.</p>
            <p class="text-md text-left font-normal md:w-10/12 mb-2">These malfunctions can cause steam and hot food to be ejected, burning anyone near the device.</p>
            <p class="text-md text-left font-normal md:w-10/12 mb-8">The 3 most common ways these burns occur are:</p>
            <ul class="mb-4 list-decimal list-inside md:w-10/12">
                <li class="px-4 py-2 box-shadow font-medium mb-4 rounded border-solid border border-gray-200">The device doesn’t lock the lid properly (although it seems locked), and the user is able to take the lid off before the pressure has been released.</li>
                <li class="px-4 py-2 box-shadow font-medium mb-4 rounded border-solid border border-gray-200">The device indicates that all the pressure has been released, when in fact the release valve was clogged and the pressure was not fully released.</li>
                <li class="px-4 py-2 box-shadow font-medium mb-4 rounded border-solid border border-gray-200">The device explodes at some point during use.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-md text-left font-normal md:w-10/12 mb-2">The burns from coming into contact with the hot food and steam of a pressure cooker explosion can cause long-term, or sometimes permanent, damage from 2nd and 3rd degree burns.</p>
            <p class="text-md text-left font-normal md:w-10/12 mb-8">Some of the victims of pressure cooker malfunctions have suffered extremely serious injuries, including some of these recent examples:</p>
            <ul class="mb-4 list-disc list-inside md:w-10/12">
                <li class="px-4 py-2 box-shadow font-medium mb-4 rounded border-solid border border-gray-200">A woman was blinded in her left eye by a piece of metal that hit her in the face after her pressure cooker exploded.</li>
                <li class="px-4 py-2 box-shadow font-medium mb-4 rounded border-solid border border-gray-200">A 2 year-old and her nanny were both badly burnt when their pressure cooker exploded as the nanny made dinner.</li>
                <li class="px-4 py-2 box-shadow font-medium mb-4 rounded border-solid border border-gray-200">A 2 year-old had to have one of her legs amputated after the explosion from her grandmother’s pressure cooker burned over 60% of her body.</li>

            <h1 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl text-center font-medium md:w-7/12 mb-8 md:mb-12 underline">Why People Don't Contact Attorneys, Or Are Told They Don't Have A Case</h1>
            <p class="text-md text-left font-normal md:w-10/12 mb-2">Many burn victims don’t contact attorneys after they are injured because they assume that being burned by a pressure cooker is something that “just happens.”</p>
            <p class="text-md text-left font-bold md:w-10/12 mb-2 underline">This is not true</p>
            <p class="text-md text-left font-normal md:w-10/12 mb-2">These injuries are caused by the gross negligence of the companies that sold these devices despite knowing that they have serious design flaws.</p>
            <p class="text-md text-left font-normal md:w-10/12 mb-2">Many other victims seek legal advice after their device burns them, only to be told they don’t  have a strong enough case to pursue a lawsuit.</p>
            <h2 class="text-xl text-center font-bold md:w-7/12 my-8">If you have been told that your case was not strong enough to pursue a lawsuit, you NEED to keep reading.</h2>
            <p class="text-md text-left font-normal md:w-10/12 mb-2">Has an attorney told you something along the lines of “Your case isn’t strong enough”? </p>
            <p class="text-md text-left font-normal md:w-10/12 mb-2">There’s a good chance that they are simply not interested in helping you because they lack the expertise or resources necessary to help you win your case.</p>
            <p class="text-md text-left font-normal md:w-10/12 mb-2">If you have been told that your case is not strong enough, DO NOT hesitate to reach out to a second attorney for another opinion.</p>
            <p class="text-md text-left font-normal md:w-10/12 mb-2">We recommend that anyone who has been burned by one of these devices reach out to a law firm that has the expertise, time, and resources to help you win your case.</p>
